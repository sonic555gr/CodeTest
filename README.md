# Images are being cached on disk up to 50Mb. At this point and due to time limitations, images have not expiration date. If they did then the chache should be cleared every 7 days just to make sure we don't over consume disk memory.

# Labels on storyboard are adjusting according to the width of the screen but, they don't adjust in height. Given the time I would make the track title, artist name, and album name to be expandable to 2 lines with autolayout.

# HTTPURLResponses and status codes are not being handled again, due to time limitations.

# It would also be good to have a conectivity manager to tell us when we have an internet connection available or not.
